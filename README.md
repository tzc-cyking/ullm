In multimodal sentiment analysis, collecting text data is often more challenging than video or audio. To address this challenge, our study has developed a robust model that effectively integrates multimodal sentiment information, even in the absence of text modality. Specifically, we have developed a Double-Flow Self-Distillation Framework, including Unified Modality Cross-Attention (UMCA) and Modality Imagination Autoencoder (MIA), which excels at processing both scenarios with complete modalities and those with missing text modality. When the text modality is missing, our framework uses the LLM-based model to simulate the text representation from the audio modality. To further align the simulated and real representations, we have also introduced the Rank-N Contrast (RNC) loss function. When testing on the CMU-MOSEI, our model achieved outstanding performance on MAE and significantly outperformed other models when text modality is missing.

## 🔧 Usage

### Requirements

Python >= 3.9

Pytorch >= 1.8.0

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```



### Inference & Evaluation

If you wish to run inference to evaluate the model's performance, please download the model weights and modality representations into their respective directories. The directory structure should be as follows:

```

├── checkpoints
│   └── mosei_mult-view_kd_full_0.5060_0.5503.pt
└── dataset
    ├── datasets_label
    │   └── cmumosei-process
	│		└── label_official.npz
    └── features_mosei
        ├── manet_FRA
        ├── vicuna-7b-v1.5-FRA-wavlm2vicuna-half-gt
        ├── vicuna-7b-v1.5-FRA-wavlm2vicuna-half-wav+prompt[take_generate_wordembed_-4]
        └── wavlm-large-FRA_-5
```

Run the script to view inference results: 

```shell
bash ./shell/main_text_missing_icassp_inference.sh
```



### Training

#### Training with extracted representations

If you want to directly use the representations we have extracted for you to train the model, you can download the representations directly from the README link and run the following script directly:

```shell
bash ./shell/main_text_missing_icassp.sh
```

#### Training with representations extracted by yourself

If you want to extract representations yourself for related experiments, you can refer to the following configuration.

**Build ./tools folder**
